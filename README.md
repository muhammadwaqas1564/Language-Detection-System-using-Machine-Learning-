# Language-Detection-System-using-Machine-Learning-
AI-powered language detection system using machine learning for accurate multilingual text identification.


Overview
  Language detection is crucial in NLP applications such as machine translation, content filtering, and sentiment analysis. Traditional rule-based methods often fail with short texts, mixed languages, and dialect variations. This project utilizes machine learning, specifically Na誰ve Bayes and SVM, to build a robust language detection system that improves accuracy and efficiency.

Key Features
  1. Data Preprocessing: Tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization.
  2. Feature Extraction: Character n-grams, word frequency analysis, and TF-IDF representations.
  3. Machine Learning Models: Implementation of Na誰ve Bayes and SVM for language classification.
  4. Performance Evaluation: Testing on diverse datasets and fine-tuning for optimal accuracy.

Technical Components
  1. Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, SpaCy
  2. Algorithms: Na誰ve Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  3. Dataset: Multilingual text corpus for supervised training

Workflow
  1. Data Collection: Gather labeled text samples from multiple languages.
  2. Preprocessing: Clean and normalize text data.
  3. Feature Engineering: Extract key linguistic patterns using character and word-based features.
  4. Model Training: Train Na誰ve Bayes and SVM models on labeled text.
  5. Evaluation: Assess performance using precision, recall, and F1-score.
  6. Integration: Deploy the model in a translation pipeline for real-time language detection.
